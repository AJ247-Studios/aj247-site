Goal:
I want to build a fully working HTML form using FormSubmit (https://formsubmit.co/).
This form should send submitted data to my email and redirect users to a thank-you page afterward.

Form Requirements:
- Method: POST
- Action: "https://formsubmit.co/YOUR_EMAIL"
- Input fields: 
  - name (text)
  - email (email)
  - service (select: Videography, Photography, Both)
  - message (textarea)
- Hidden fields:
  - _subject: custom subject for the email
  - _captcha: false (disable FormSubmit CAPTCHA)
  - _template: box (better-looking email layout)
  - _next: redirect to thank-you.html after submission

Bonus:
- Add required field validation
- Semantic labels and accessible HTML
- Use placeholder images if needed
- Style it with CSS later

Don't use JavaScript or external libraries. This form should be plain HTML + FormSubmit.
